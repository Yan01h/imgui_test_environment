# imgui_test_environment

A quick test environment for imgui with GLFW and OpenGL 2, made to quickly get started writing imgui code without having to do a lot of setup.

## How to use

1. Clone with git or download and run premake with the `premake5.lua` file in the root directory
2. Open `imgui_test_environment.cpp` (this is really the only file you need) and start writing code

## Thirdparty libraries
